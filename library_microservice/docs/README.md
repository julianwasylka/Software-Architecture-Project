# Git branching
The git branching model used was [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). It defines a set of standard branches and workflows for managing development and releases. It is a popular choice for software development teams because it provides a clear and structured way to collaborate and maintain code quality. Some of the advantages of using Git Flow are:
- **Improved collaboration:** Git Flow promotes collaboration among team members by defining clear roles and responsibilities for each branch. 
- **Better code quality:** By separating development work into feature branches, Git Flow helps to ensure that code is thoroughly tested and reviewed before it is merged into the main branch. 
- **Easier releases:** Git Flow makes it easier to manage releases by providing a clear path from development to production. 
- **Reduced risk:** Git Flow helps to reduce the risk of introducing bugs into production by providing a way to isolate changes and test them thoroughly before merging them into the main branch.

# Commits methodology
In order to allow an easy analysis of the work developed, the following commit methodology suffixes were adopted:

- `Add:` --> Created something new in the repository
- `Update:` --> Updated something that already existed
- `Delete:` --> Deleted something that already existed

## Design Requirement 2 - Cloning

### Quality Attributes Table

| Attribute            | Description                                                                                                                              |

| **Response Measure** | Successful deployment of multiple instances of each microservice and its database, verified by load testing and availability monitoring. |

### Technical Memo for Transition to Microservices

- **Issue**: The system needs to ensure scalability and fault tolerance by running multiple instances of each microservice in a containerized environment.
- **Problem**: Running a single instance of each microservice limits the system's ability to handle high traffic and introduces a single point of failure.
- **Summary of Solution**: Deploy each microservice (Command and Query) in a separate Docker container, along with its dedicated database in another container, enabling multiple instances for scalability and resilience.
- **Factors**: Scalability, fault tolerance, independent deployment, and simplified infrastructure management.
- **Solution**:
  - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the deployment of containers for microservices and their respective databases.
  - Ensure each microservice (e.g., LendingsCommand and LendingsQuery) runs in isolated containers, communicating over the network.
  - Implement a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for scaling and managing multiple instances.
  - Ensure databases are independently containerized and configured for high availability and persistence.
- **Motivation**: Running microservices and their databases in isolated containers ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and ease of replication in different environments.
- **Alternatives**:
    - **Option 1**: Deploy microservices without containerization.
        - **Pros**: Avoids the complexity of container orchestration.
        - **Cons**: Limited portability, scalability, and resource isolation.
    - **Option 2**: Deploy microservices in virtual machines instead of containers.
        - **Pros**: Greater resource allocation and isolation.
        - **Cons**: Higher overhead compared to lightweight containers.
- **Pending Issues**: Ensure inter-service communication, logging, and monitoring are optimized across multiple instances (resolved using RabbitMQ and centralized logging).

## Patterns adoption

The following architectural patterns were adopted in the design and implementation of the application to ensure scalability, maintainability, and proper domain-driven design principles:

**Strangler Fig Pattern**
- The Strangler Fig Pattern was used to incrementally migrate the monolithic application into a microservices architecture. Existing functionality was gradually replaced with new microservices without disrupting ongoing operations. This approach allowed for seamless migration by routing requests to either the monolith or the new microservices based on the feature set.

**Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**
- The CQRS pattern was implemented by splitting each domain into two distinct services: one for handling commands (write operations) and another for handling queries (read operations). For example, the Lendings microservice was divided into LendingsCommand and LendingsQuery, each with its own logic and database. This separation optimizes the system for scalability and ensures that read and write concerns are addressed independently.

**Database-per-Service**
- Each microservice operates with its own dedicated database under the Database-per-Service pattern. For instance, LendingsCommand and LendingsQuery have separate databases to ensure data ownership and isolation. This allows independent scaling of services and minimizes coupling between microservices.

**Polyglot Persistence**
- To optimize each microserviceâ€™s functionality, the application adopted Polyglot Persistence, using different database technologies based on the use case. For example, a relational database like PostgreSQL is used for transactional services, while a document database like MongoDB is used for services requiring unstructured data storage.

**Messaging**
- The application uses asynchronous messaging to facilitate communication between microservices. This decouples services, ensuring loose coupling and fault tolerance. RabbitMQ is used as the AMQP message broker, enabling reliable message delivery and event-driven communication across services.

**Domain Events**
- Domain Events are used to capture significant occurrences within the system. For instance, when a book is created or updated in the LibraryCommand service, a corresponding domain event is published to notify other services (e.g., StatisticsCommand or LendingsCommand). This ensures consistency across the system while maintaining service independence.

**Saga**
- The Saga pattern was implemented to handle distributed transactions across multiple microservices. For example, in the lending process, when returning a book with a recommendation the LendingsCommand microservice coordinates with other services like LibraryCommand to ensure the transaction completes successfully or rolls back in case of failure. This was achieved using a choreographed approach, where services communicate through domain events.
